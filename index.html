                <h3> Steps to Get Started </h3>
    <p><b> - Create a slipknot</b>: This is the initial loop you will put on your hook. </p>


    <p><b> - Start Crocheting a Chain</b>: This serves as the foundation row.
                                           The length of the chain will depend on the project 
                                           you're working on.</p>


   <p><b> - Turn and Start Second Row</b>: Once your chain is long enough, you will turn your work and
                                           start crocheting into the stiches of the chain.</p>  

                                           
   <p><b> - Continue with patterns</b>: Follow your pattern, continue making stitches in each new row .</p>                                      


   <p><b> - Finish the project</b>: When your project is the right size, cut the yarn leaving a tail.
                                    Yarn over and pull through the loop on your hook to secure it.</p>

    <p><b> - Weave in Ends</b>: Use your yarn needle to weave in any loose ends.</p>       
    
    
    <h4>NOTE: </h4>
   <p>Remember, learning to crochet requires patience. Start with simpler projects like scarves or 
      dishcloths before moving on to more complex items like hats or blankets. Once you get the hang
      of the basic stitches, you'll be able to tackle almost any pattern. Enjoy the process and 
      <i><b>happy crocheting!</b></i></p>
